DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR COURSE (STUDENTS VISA 500).

Before you think of possible ways of changing your principal course in your education provider, it is important you refresh your memory with the various AQF levels which include:

- Certificate I - Level 1
- Certificate II - Level 2
- Certificate III - Level 3
- Certificate IV - Level 4
- Diploma - Level 5
- Advanced Diploma - Level 6
- Bachelor Degree - Level 7
- Bachelor Honours Degree - Level 8
- Masters Degree - Level 9
- Doctoral Degree - Level 10

As we all know, AQF stands for Australian Qualification Framework. I observed recently that most of the students studying here in Australia, definitely want to change their courses but unfortunately they are not aware of these student visa conditions. However, there are procedures in changing students visa, but that can only be achieved if you continue to meet the conditions that apply to the students visa.

undoubtedly; you must have watched videos or red about the visa conditions, but the condition I would discuss here in depth, is the 8202 condition. Though! 8202 condition has some limitations, it does not allow you to transfer to a lower AQF level, it basically require students to maintain enrolment in a course at the same level or higher AFQ level for which they were granted the visa, unless the change is from an AQF level 10 to AQF level 9. Breaching condition 8202 makes you vulnerable to visa cancellation and if your student visa is been cancelled, it makes it very difficult for you to get another Australian visa.

Though the transfer procedure varies, depending on the providers education transfer policy. That's why I will advice you ensure you understand your education provider’s transfer policies and what your written agreement says you must do before enrolling with any provider. In order to avoid breaching condition 8202, the students holding a visa of this subclass, who wishes to drop the AQF level of their course, certainly would be required to apply for a new student visa and they are not expected to start in the lower AQF course pending when the new visa will be approved.

Accordingly, if your education provider does not permit you to transfer to another education provider and you are not satisfied with the policy, you should first use your education provider’s internal appeal process and if you are still not satisfied, you can appeal the education provider’s decision at an external complaints.

Furthermore, if you've not completed the main course of study you're undertaking and you want to change your education provider, what helps to explain the circumstances in which this will be possible is the ESOS National Code, Unless for special circumstances apply, that you would need to have permission from your existing education provider to transfer to another education provider.

For students holding a student visa subclass 500, changing their principal course to a lower Australian Qualification Framework (AQF) level course or a non-AQF level course, what is required is a new student visa. This requirement applies even if the course you change to is with the same education provider. Note that You will not need to apply for a new visa if you are changing from an AQF level 10 course (doctoral degree) to an AQF level 9 course (Masters degree).

For example, if your visa was granted for your enrolment in a Master of accounting degree (level 9) course and you want to change your course to a Diploma of Management (level 5) course, all you need to do is to cheerfully apply for a new student visa. Changing your course without obtaining a new visa associated with your lowered level course will result in your breach in condition 8202 and would result in the cancellation of your student visa which you already know the implications.

Hence; only students studying level 10 (Doctorate) courses have the permission to drop to level 9 (Masters) courses without any challenges. Moving to a higher level is verily allowed . Also, condition 8202 does not worry about the education provider you are with, the worries is for you to satisfy the requirements.
