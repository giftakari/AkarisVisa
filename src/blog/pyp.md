### KEY THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE ENROLLING IN A PROFESSIONAL YEAR PROGRAM.

Before I proceed, let's swiftly look at the meaning of a Professional Year Program (PYP). Professional Year Program, otherwise called Job Preparedness program, is a structured career development designed to enhance a student's ability to obtain employment in their chosen discipline by applying technical skills and knowledge in the Australian workplace and culture.

There are things to put into consideration before embarking on a Professional Year Program.
The first thing to consider is

THE TIMING
The duration for the PYP is 44 weeks, where you will take part in a 12 week professional internship in the IT field organised by specialist internship placements team, in the participant's chosen discipline. A Professional Year Program is necessary because it helps to increase your points and it also adds value to your resume.

Some students would want to start a Professional Year Program once they've already been granted 485 Visa, that is the Skilled Graduate (temporary) Visa Subclass. for example, a student may have a visa that will be expiring on the 31st of January 2020 and your completion letter will be out on the 1st of December 2020, So you may intend to lodge your 485 visa on the 15th of December which will make you eligible to start a PYP, so the earlier you round up your program the earlier it will enable you claim 5 points and also give you enough time to prepare for your PR application.

PYP Combines formal learning and workplace experience, it teaches participants how to communicate effectively in an Australian workplace environment. The essence of the internship is to familiarise participants about all aspects of work practices in an Australian workplace and it is usually done in the applicant's nominated skilled occupation or in a closely related occupation.

Another important thing to note is the
PROVIDERS LOCATION AND FLEXIBILITY.
Considering the changes that occurs frequently in migration laws and the state changing the requirements whenever the need arises, what I will advice you is to go for a provider that is available in almost all of the states in Australia. Reason been that, you might be in the middle of the program and may want to move from one state to another, and along the line, you find out that your provider don't have campuses in that state, such experience could be so disheartening and devastating, so the best thing is to ensure that your provider is available in all most all states of Australia to enable you get transfered easily from one state or campus location to another.

Another thing of great importance is for you to check if your provider have WEEKEND and WEEKDAYS CLASSES, not only that, you have to also confirm if they can easily transfer you between these classes, in case your employment situation changes in the process of your study and you may consider switching from either of them to another, so it is good you know if your provider welcomes all of these.

The fourth thing is to look critically into the QUALITY OF INTERNSHIP that your provider provides. Though there are ample of providers in Australia who render Professional Year Programs, but believe me there are only few that has good reputation when it comes to providing quality Internship, so you need to be very careful on this aspect, also you need to know if they offer Internship in your nominated occupation.

PAYMENT PLAN OPTION is another thing to seek great clarity, because definitely you must have spent thousands of dollars in your study and you finally obtained your 485 visa with work rights. It will certainly be your wish to be offered with a flexible payment plan, to help relief you from the burden of fees, because you can actually settle your fees with your own earnings if the payment plan is flexible.
