### HOW TO CALCULATE AND INCREASE YOUR POINTS FOR THE SKILLED MIGRATION VISAS.

As we all know for the skilled migration Visas or as we can also call it a point tested Visas, the point requirement is 65, So the Visas classes are:

189 Visas, 190 Visas and 489 Visas. So if you are planning to lodge 189 Visas which is the skilled independent Visas, you need 65 points on your own, and if you're planning to lodge 190 Visas which is the Skilled nominated Visas, you need 60 points of your own while the state will add 5 points, and if you're planning to lodge 489 Visas which is the regional provisional Visas, you need 55 points of your own then the state will add 10 points to make it 65 points.

Herein, we will be discussing points allocated to an applicant for every aspect and the first one is your:

**AGE**

You do get maximum point if you're within the age of 25-32, now Australia consider this age as very very productive, so that's why you do get maximum points for your age in this bracket. Also, some people do get confused that they've only turned 32 if they will be able to claim point. The answer is "Yes" so you can claim points till the day you have not turned 33.

**Points Table ( AGE)**

1. **18--24yrs [25]**
2. **25--32yrs [30]**
3. **33--39yrs [25]**
4. **40--44yrs [15]**

**ENGLISH**

English is the second one and you do need a minimum of 6 each to lodge your expression of interest. However, you don't get any point for that, to claim points for your English you do need a minimum of 7 each and you get 10 points for that.

If you've worked outside Australia for 3yrs in your nominated occupation and unfortunately you can not claim any point. You can't claim any point if you have done a minimum of 3yrs outside Australia in your nominated occupation, and you can claim 5 points for that.

The next one is:

#### SKILLED EMPLOYMENT INSIDE AUSTRALIA.

So most of you , if you're an international student and will be going for the 489 Visas, then you may be able to get out skilled employment in your nominated occupation for 1-2yrs and you will be able to claim 5 points for this.

### QUALIFICATIONS

So, please note that you will get points for your highest qualifications, so for example, you have done Diploma in Australia, but you also have a bachelors degree in Osees. You may be able to claim points for your bachelors which is 15 points and also please note that, the qualifications does not have to be related to your nominated occupation.
So what it means is that, if your nominated occupation is Chef and you have a bachelors degree in accounting, you will still be able to claim 15 points for your bachelors.

The next one is:

#### AUSTRALIA STUDY REQUIREMENTS.

So most of you who have done your studies in Australia, you will be able to claim points for your Australian study.  
The requirement is that you have to have studied 2yrs in Australia, so if you have done that, for example you have done your masters or a bachelors or a Diploma which is for 2yrs.
Then you will be able to claim 5 points for your study. There are also points for the specialist education qualification which is 5 points, though many of you might not be eligible for that because there are only very few fields in which you can claim this extra 5 points, you can also claim 5 points for NAATI.

**2yrs [5] points**

#### (SPECIALIST EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS, ONLY A FEW FIELDS)

**5 Points**

The next one is your:

#### PARTNER SKILLS

You can't claim 5 points for your partner skills, but please be aware that your partner has to be under 45yrs of age. They need to have 6 each and they need to have skill assessment in the occupation which is on the same list as yours. So what this means is that if your occupation is on the MLTSSL list, then your partners occupation have to be on the MLTSSL list as well otherwise you won't be able to claim points for your partner.

You can also claim 5 points for:

#### REGIONAL STUDIES,

So you have to have lived and studied in a regional area for two (2) years to be able to claim 5 points. You can also claim for your professional programme you're doing in Australia, so you get 5 points, but professional year programme is only available in IT, Engineering and Accounting. you may have been able to calculate how many points you have by the end of your studies, now! also keep in mind if you're someone who is on bridging Visa see studying or have gotten any employment or experience in Australia, unfortunately won't be able to claim any point for your study.
Or employment you're on bridging Visa see if you think you wont be able to secure ISM or PTE equivalent, there are some things you need to do to increase your points.

**Points Table**  
STUDY AND LIVE IN REGIONAL AUSTRALIA
**2 years [5] points**

#### PROFESSIONAL YEAR PROGRAMME

IT, ENGINEERING AND ACCOUNTING.

**[5] Points**

#### THINGS YOU NEED TO DO TO INCREASE YOUR POINTS.

The first thing is that you can do NAATI, you can do professional year programme because they both give you 5 points each . The other thing you should really consider is, studying in your regional area, so even if you have studied your bachelors during your first and second semester, you should consider moving into a regional area.

Because Australian studying in a regional area will give you extra 5 points and also states like Tesminia, Northern Teriterian and Southern Australia, the whole state is actually a regional area and you will be able to secure 5 points if you had plan to lodge into 190 Visas in the future and you're planning to lodge 489 provisional Visa, then you will be able to get 10 points from your state, which means you will be able to secure 15 extra points if you move to a regional area for your studies.
