### TIPS ON HOW YOU CAN SECURE A JOB IN AUSTRALIA IN LESS THAN 2 WEEKS.

As an international student in Australia, there are certain rights and privileges that you have, you're allowed to work for a limited hours a week as a student studying in Australia. you also have the right to work in a limited hours when your classes are not in session, furthermore, it is important you know that you're not allowed to work more than that because if you do, you will put yourself in a bunch of issues.
I will be discussing 6 job hunting tips for international students.

### TIP 1 : TFN & ABN NUMBER.

The first tip is to apply for TFN & ABN number, these numbers are mandatory in Australia most especially for those who may want to work and do businesses in Australia. You can apply both of them in the Australian taxation office website.

TFN stands for Tax File Number which is a very unique identifier issued by the Australian taxation office (ATO) to each tax payable entity( individual, company, partnership or trust etc.) While the AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS NUMBER (ABN) is also a unique identifier issued to Business owners by the Australian Business Register (ABR) which is operated by the Australian Taxation Office. The TFN is something you can not ignore because it is a mandatory requirement for you to be eligible to work anywhere in Australia.

So it is always advisable you get this done once you get a residential address for yourself, the ABN helps you to also register yourself as a business mostly as a sole trader because in case you want to work as Uber driver, delivery driver etc. then you have to apply for this as well because it is a mandatory requirement for you to apply for such jobs here in Australia.

### TIP 2: SHORT COURSES AND CERTIFICATIONS

You can increase your chances of getting a job by enrolling in short courses and certifications. Though it could be challenging but it is necessary you do this to be at advantage, you can spend about $100 and get yourself certifications that could be really helpful to you in the future.
On the long run , if you have the intention of getting  into industries like Night club, Bar or a restaurant that sells alcohol then you can get yourself RC license which is the Responsible Service of Alcohol and you can do this course for about $50 - \$100 depending on the institution you're getting it from. the duration for this course is just a day and you will get certification immediately on the same day.

Barista skill course is another important course to do because Australians have many Gofies with available opportunities. so if you get certifications it will be very easy for you to get a job, this will cost you about \$100 and it is just a day course as well, except in some cases where you want to do an advanced course, that is when it will take you for about two days but this isn't a mandatory requirement.

Another certification that will be very helpful is the Construction White Card, this is quite expensive compared to others listed herein, you get this certification for about $150 - $250 and it is a one day course. this is important because construction sites here in Australia are massive with ample of opportunities, so it focuses on how you can handle yourself when you are working in a construction site.

The Traffic Controller License is another one you can get to increase your chances though it is expensive like the CWC but it is necessary you do it, because if youre in Australia then am sure you must have seen people holding STOP and SLOW signs. This is a certification basically for them, many of my friends are into this and are making good money because the pay is about $40 in an hour. the amount required to gain this course is about $150 - \$250, so if you're considering of going into this industry in a long run then it is verily advisable you go for this License.

### TIP 3 : MAKE A LIST OF AVAILABLE JOB

It is important you make a list of available jobs you know you are eligible to work as a student, because you know that you have a limited working hours of 20hrs a week. So make sure you don't waist your time applying for jobs that are meant for Full-Time workers and are asking for candidates with a permanent residence so try as much as possible to know the job type and requirements before applying for any job to avoid time wastage.

The most favourable sites for students applying for jobs are GUMTREE and AIRTASKER. The Gumtree is the best, it helps to give you jobs that are just for weekends, while the Airtasker provides seasonal jobs which you can also try as well. Though you can as well visit sites like seek.com but know that most jobs advertised here require Full-Time people that's why I always recommend and prefer Gumtree and Airtasker but Gumtree remains the best option. Major target are places like retails, shopping centres, restaurants, Cafes, Nursing homes etc. because most of these jobs usually have available opportunities and can easily employ you even when you have no experience.

### TIP 4: ALWAYS STAY POSITIVE AND MOTIVATED.

This tip is one of the most important tip ever, you need to stay happy and always motivated even in the midst of challenges. though life could be so overwhelming when you fine yourself in a foreign country where you don't have friends, No relatives or family. But regardless of these, you need to always remember and understand that we go to different places to create a difference in our lives, to learn something new and to explore ourselves. we move out of our comfort zones to achieve something in life so always remember your family and their continuous effort in praying for you to succeed in life.

### TIP 5: ESTABLISH GOOD NETWORK.

Having a good networking system such as making good friends and been kind to them, having good business relationship with people and joining various social media groups such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc. is very important.
As you know, in Australia strong reference from a friend is very acknowledgeable and given preference.

### TIP 6 : MULTIPLE CVs

It is important you know that it is wrong for you to apply for various jobs in different industries with the same resume, because most companies these days make their recruitment process much more easy by using program called application tracking system which filters down a lot of resumes and shortlists only the ones who have the key words that matches their job description.
e.g if a company is looking for someone with experience in high attention to details and you're able to inculcate that word in your resume, then your resume have an advantage of been shortlisted. So make sure you have multiple resumes depending on the industry you're sending to.
